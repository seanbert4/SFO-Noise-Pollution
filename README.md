# SFO-Noise-Pollution

Hi HR!

This project crunches numbers. 
The numbers come from public noise pollution data, specifically complaints from callers about excessive airplane noise from aircraft flying into or out of San Francisco Int'l Airport.
The interface runs exclusively through Javascript prompt windows.
Users can run a number of reports that slice and dice the data in a variety of ways.
The program outputs the results via a sorted list or a bar graph.

Hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.
